1. GitHub Pages URL: https://zaberoy21.github.io/UnivSearch/
   (Since the API call in this page uses an http server, github pages, which uses https, blocks it. I used a CORS link to workaround this, however it only seems to work
   if the url is copied into a web browser and temporary access is enabled).

2. The API that I chose provides a list of the world's Universities and their respective countries and domains. I chose to use this API because it reflects my lifestyle as a college student and provides simple yet practical data that can be utilized to create a resourceful web application.

3. The main function of my webpage involves searching a certain country and providing a list of universities from that country. An additional application of the API is that once the list of universities is provided, the user may select a certain university from the list and clicking on it will open a link to the school's main web page. 

4. I made the website responsive by selecting an API that does not provide too many results from a search query. The website also functions on mobile devices.

5. This app can me made accessible to people with disabilities by having a feature that responds to voice commands so the user does not have to physically interact with the interface. The app can also have audio that prompts the user to interact and describes in detail the functions of the website. 

6. To improve the experience of my applicaiton and expand its capabilities, I will implement an additional option that will allow the user to directly search for a university by name. A filter would be implemented as well to make this searching process more practical.
